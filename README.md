### Why use dxlib?

- Organized: Clean namespaces for different functionalities
- Cross-platform support with Windows and Linux compatibility
- Simple API designed to speed up your terminal-only projects!

### Who is it for?

- dxlib is for beginners who want to get comfortable with C++
without writing verbose boilerplate. It wraps many features into a simple, beginner-friendly interface.
Then they can move on to learn `std::cin`, or `std::cout` or other functions. So basically its
training wheels and then move on to learn the actual stuff.

It turned into a utility library that makes many common tasks much simpler.
