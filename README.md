# Welcome to dxlib!
## v1.2.1

**dxlib** is a lightweight, easy-to-use C++ header-only library that provides a collection of utilities and tools for:

- Mathematical calculations (geometry, trigonometry, volumes)
- File operations (reading, writing, copying, deleting)
- String and text manipulation (trimming, case changes, etc..)
- Time and date utilities
- Random number generation and string creation
- Console input/output helpers

---

### Why use dxlib?

- Organized: Clean namespaces for different functionalities
- Cross-platform support with Windows and Linux compatibility
- Simple API designed to speed up your terminal-only projects!

---

### Who is it for?

- dxlib is for beginners who want to get comfortable with C++
without writing verbose boilerplate. It wraps many features into a simple, beginner-friendly interface.
Then they can move on to learn `std::cin`, or `std::cout` or other functions. So basically its
training wheels and then move on to learn the actual stuff.

### Why did i create it?

- I built dxlib as a personal challenge to improve my C++.
It turned into a utility library that makes many common tasks much simpler.
